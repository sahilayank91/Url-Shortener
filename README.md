# Task 1: Write a function to shorten a URL

## Description

To complete this task, wrote a single function in the file `src/shorten.js`. The file includes documentation on the requirements.

Do not modify `package.json` or introduce additional modules. Only the Node standard library should be used to complete this task.

Also included a small test suite to check whether the code you've written works as expected.

## Testing

To execute all tests, use the tests script:

    $ npm run test
